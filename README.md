# Fake News Detection 

## Overview

Fake news has become a significant issue in today's digital age, influencing public opinion and spreading misinformation. This project addresses the problem by building a robust **Fake News Detection System** using advanced **Hugging Face Transformers**. The system is capable of identifying whether a given news article or statement is genuine or fake.

## Problem Statement

The rapid spread of misinformation through online platforms and social media has created the need for reliable tools to combat fake news. Identifying fake news manually is time-consuming and prone to bias. This project automates the detection of fake news using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, ensuring scalability and accuracy.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop and deploy a machine learning model capable of analyzing textual data and accurately classifying it as either **real** or **fake** news. The solution is deployed using Hugging Face Transformers to make it accessible and scalable.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Built on Hugging Face Transformers for state-of-the-art text classification.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Deployed on Hugging Face for seamless integration and access.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Provides instant results for news articles or headlines.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Collected datasets from Kaggle and other reliable sources containing labeled news articles.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and tokenized text data.
   - Removed stop words, special characters, and performed lemmatization.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Used a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) from Hugging Face.
   - Fine-tuned the model on the fake news dataset.

4. **Training**:
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
   - Used PyTorch/TensorFlow backend for training with optimization techniques like AdamW.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Measured performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Validated the model with a test dataset to ensure generalizability.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deployed the model on Hugging Face for public access.
   - API created for real-time predictions.

## Scope

- **Immediate Use**: Detects fake news effectively from textual inputs such as headlines or articles.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Incorporating language detection and translation for multilingual support.
  - Extending the dataset to include more diverse topics and sources.
  - Developing a user-friendly web or mobile application interface.
