# Project Name

This project is deployed on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) and utilizes **Streamlit** for building the user interface.

## Features
- **Streamlit Integration**: Interactive and user-friendly UI.
- **Hugging Face Deployment**: Easily accessible via Hugging Face Spaces.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: The app processes user inputs in real-time for immediate results.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Displays dynamic charts and graphs for better insights.
- **Model Integration**: Leverages pre-trained models hosted on Hugging Face for accurate predictions.
- **User Customization**: Allows users to adjust parameters and settings directly through the UI.

## Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository from Hugging Face Spaces
To set up the project locally, first clone the repository hosted on Hugging Face Spaces. Replace `your-huggingface-repo` with the actual URL of your repository:

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/your-huggingface-repo
cd your-huggingface-repo
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application Locally
Run the Streamlit app locally with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will start, and you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Notes

1. **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**: If the repository includes large files (e.g., models or datasets), ensure you have Git LFS installed and initialized before cloning.
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```
2. **Model Files**: If the application relies on Hugging Face models, they will be automatically downloaded when the app is executed for the first time.
